# Data Wrangling and Processing Project

This project includes a set of Python scripts for data wrangling and processing, as well as accessing and visualizing data from a SQL database in real-time. The project is designed to streamline the data preparation and analysis process, allowing users to easily clean, manipulate, and analyze large data sets.

## Features
1. Data wrangling and cleansing: Python scripts for cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis. Includes handling duplicates, missing values, and converting data types.
2. Data processing and mining: Python scripts for processing and analyzing data. Includes calculating summary statistics, aggregating data, and performing machine learning tasks.
3. Data accessing to SQL database: Python scripts for connecting to and accessing data from a SQL database. Includes extracting data, updating or modifying data, and writing new data to the database.
4. Real-time data visualization: Scripts for visualizing data in real-time using Grafana. Allows for easy monitoring of data streams and analysis of trends over time.

These features together can be part of a data pipeline, which is a sequence of steps to transform raw data into a format that is ready for analysis.
