Hereby I would like to suggest some of the basics tasks that I have been through so far. 

This is the project of Importing data into MariaDB

It contains various tasks as:

1. Python to Sql Connection
2. Create a table
3. Insert data in table

Make sure here I used _db_maschinendaten.DBF file for my source file, you can find it here
