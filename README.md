# Data Wrangling and Processing Project

This project includes a set of Python scripts for data wrangling and processing, as well as accessing and visualizing data from a SQL database in real-time. The project is designed to streamline the data preparation and analysis process, allowing users to easily clean, manipulate, and analyze large data sets.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

Data wrangling and cleansing: The project includes Python scripts for cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis. These scripts handle a variety of common data cleaning tasks, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.

Data processing and mining: The project includes Python scripts for processing and analyzing data, such as calculating summary statistics, aggregating data, and performing machine learning tasks.

Data accessing to SQL database: The project includes Python scripts for connecting to and accessing data from a SQL database. These scripts can be used to extract data from a database, update or modify data, and write new data to the database.

Real-time data visualization: The project includes scripts for visualizing data in real-time using Grafana, an open-source dashboarding platform. This allows users to easily monitor data streams and analyze trends over time.
